This library simplifies the process of adding resources during runtime. It's meant to be used internally by Hellish Mods, but you can use it if you want, we even wrote [some documentation](https://wiki.modernmodpacks.site/wiki/v/hellish-mods/digitality) for that case!

If you're just a regular player, ignore what I've just said. You're probably here because some of your mods don't work without it. Just download the file and move on. Oh and while you're at it, [check out some of our other mods](https://www.curseforge.com/members/hellishmods/projects) too!
